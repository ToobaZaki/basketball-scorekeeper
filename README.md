Basketball ScoreKeeper

Project Overview:

Basketball ScoreKeeper is a simple web-based application designed to keep track of the scores for two basketball teams, Team A and Team B. Users can easily update the score for each team by adding points (1, 2, or 3 points) based on the game actions, such as free throws or regular baskets. The app also provides a reset option to clear the scores and start fresh.

Display updated scores in real-time.

Supports scoring options for +3 Points, +2 Points, and Free Throws (+1 Point).

Simple Reset button to reset both teams' scores to zero.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure and layout of the web page.

CSS: Styling to provide a clean and simple design.

JavaScript: Manages score updates, button functionality, and reset action.

Future Improvements:

Add support for team names to be customized.

Include a timer for the game to simulate real match conditions.
